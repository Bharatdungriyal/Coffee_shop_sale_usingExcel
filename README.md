# Coffee Shop Data Analysis Using Excel

## Introduction
This project is designed to analyze key performance metrics for a coffee shop using **Excel**. The analysis includes top sales, top footfall, average bill per person, and average order per person. The data is processed and visualized in an interactive Excel dashboard, providing meaningful insights to help business owners make informed decisions.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Overview
The project begins with raw transactional data, which includes details about sales, customer footfall, and order specifics. This raw data is processed and cleaned in Excel to generate relevant insights.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Processing
We clean and process the raw data in Excel to ensure accuracy before analysis:
- Removed missing or incomplete data entries
- De-duplicated records
- Standardized date formats and currency values
- Created calculated fields such as total sales, customer count, and average metrics

### 3. Key Metrics on the Dashboard
The Excel dashboard highlights four key performance indicators (KPIs):

#### a. Top Sale
- Displays the **top-selling items** in the coffee shop.
- Helps identify which products generate the highest revenue.

#### b. Top Footfall
- Shows the **days or times** with the highest customer footfall.
- Assists in recognizing peak times for customers, which can help with resource allocation.

#### c. Average Bill Per Person
- Calculates the **average spending per customer**.
- This metric gives an overview of customer spending behavior and helps in setting pricing strategies.

#### d. Average Order Per Person
- Tracks the **average number of items** ordered by each customer.
- Useful for understanding customer purchasing habits, leading to menu optimization.

### 4. Excel Dashboard Overview
The Excel dashboard allows easy filtering and interaction with the data to explore insights by:
- Time period (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Product categories (e.g., beverages, food, desserts)
- Customer segments (if applicable)

**Dashboard Features:**
- **Pivot Tables** to summarize sales and footfall data.
- **Charts and Graphs** to visualize trends and performance.
- **Slicers** to filter data dynamically by different categories (e.g., time, product type).

### 5. Insights
The dashboard provides clear insights into the coffee shop's operations, such as:
- Which products contribute the most to sales (Top Sale)
- The busiest times of day or week (Top Footfall)
- Customer spending patterns (Avg Bill Per Person)
- The average number of items per customer order (Avg Order Per Person)

### 6. Export or Share Excel Dashboard
The Excel dashboard can be shared with stakeholders in several ways:
- Sharing the Excel file directly
- Exporting specific charts and tables as images for reports or presentations
- Converting the data into PDF for easy viewing and sharing
